# Spellbook

Spellbook is a program for viewing markdown files with the browser. The idea is to set `spellbook open` as the default program for opening `.md` files when double-clicking them in the file explorer. The program will open them in the web browser with nice formatting.

Spellbook also lets you run code blocks in markdown files by clicking on the "Run" button at the top left. For this reason, it runs a server on the background listening for requests coming from localhost and uses this to know when to execute the scripts.

The program is mostly meant for me to use it in my local PC. It has a bunch of annoying setup that I may or may not document in the future, some features may be half-done and it may not support your use case. Use at your own risk. This is a one day project.

If you have a use case like this and would like an actual product, maybe try [Atuin Desktop](https://blog.atuin.sh/atuin-desktop-runbooks-that-run/). It looks much more fully featured.
